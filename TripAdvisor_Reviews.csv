0,We visited for temple tour from chennai had a fantastic stay here. Rooms are cleaned as per covid standard. All the common places they kept sanitizerüß¥ü§≤. Recommended for all. Overall good Hospitality. Keep it up. ‚ù§ Read more
1,The rooms and bathrooms are neat and clean. Functional hotel. There is kettle and tea and coffee in the rooms The extra bed was comfortable.  Breakfast had limited options but that‚Äôs understandable considering it was served in room and low occupancy levels. The hotel has ample car parking as well one among few hotels to do so.
2,We stayed last one month due to lock down felt home fell for every day. All the staff members was approachable  Especially Front office Mr. selva and SO Mr. Anbu  Extraordinary support gave us. Room service was good  Breakfast and dinner was so yummy
3,House keeping persons were done to excellent services. Timely got the best services. Especially shanthi mam done very much clean work ontime and well disciplines . Thanks to redfox team for given the best and great work.
4,"Stayed at redfox Hotel on transit, room was clean and COVID measure were in place with sanitizers at lift and at restaurant. Food was tasty at restaurant and staff were well behaved across. Over all nice stay."
5,"Check-in and Check out was uneventful.  The rooms were good and clean.  The room service was pretty quick.  The restaurant service was also quick, although the morning breakfast was minimal.  However considering these times, they made sure they served you what you wanted and in real quick time."
6,Have visited post lockdown and found the precautions to be in place. This is my second time with Red Fox. Facilities have been limited but that's understandable considering the current circumstances. Over all safe and good stay.
7,"If you are in Trichy for a short stay to visit the temples and the city, then,this is a good place to stay.  Booked the hotel because of the Lemonteee Brand which in scenarios like now where safety is paramount , is critical.  Located right opposite to the central bus stand, location is both a plus n a minus,  but as I mentioned , it is perfect for people who will spend a large part of their time sightseeing or visiting places in Trichy.  Safety protocols are generally adhered to.  Food tastes good (options are limited though, currently) and the service levels are good and prompt.  The standard rooms should provide more space. Standard Rooms are small and cramped- could certainly do better there.  Overall, a decent hotel for travellers who would want a comfortable stay after‚Ä¶"
8,Hi stayed there for 2 days with family.. it was awesome stay.. food was good.. my son was injured at the time we reached.. staff helped us instantly.. flora was really supportive throughout the stay..they provided milk for kid.. restaurant staff was quick in serving.. room was good n pleasant.. overall it was awesome stay..  definitely we will stay again..
9,Had a good experience. Stayed more than a week I'd not felt anything BaD to comment expect one thing which i felt too BaD is they are not allowing people into our room even our relatives as well expect the one whos is staying rather than that all is gud... Receptionist Miss Flora and Room serving lady are too good I'd like the way of their answering with a pleasant smile every time..... For foodies guys u ill get a compliment breakfast as much want.....
10,"I stayed before one month . The hotel is also very centrally located and you can never miss it coz of the RED color! The food at the restaurant was great too! Great service  overall! Will recommend to anyone who wants to stay comfortable and yet in a budget at Tirchy. Especially the staffs were very friendly Selva, Renganathan very helpful in all the times and lady in the front is always kind and smile on her face"
11,I like the service done by all staff.. Special mention N.L.Renganathan was very professional..I would like to suggest providing complementary for either dinner or laundry. Cos ppl who stay for business purposes can't wash their dresses in the room.. I wish I would come back and stay again here..‚ò∫Ô∏è
12,This hotel is the best offer one can get around town. Their hospitality and willingness to help is next to non. I made my booking online but I wasn't disappointed the fact that I arrived and checked-in earlier than expected without extra charges. They also organised for me the transport means to the airport that made my experience in Trichy a memorable one. Front desk services were exceptionally good as the lady was always welcoming and willing to help. It's a good place for people from diverse backgrounds as they serve indiscriminately. Give it a try you won't get disappointed
13,No safe for ladies. Front office man Mr.ranganathan speak with very sexy.I am very angry with this guy.food taste normal very spicy.wifi also dead slow.night time house keeping service slow.divya good.
14,"i loved every part of this hotel! It was budget friendly, clean, modern looking and friendly staff! Room was just nice for a boutique hotel. The hotel is also very centrally located and you can never miss it coz of the RED color! The food at the restaurant was great too! Great service in overall! Will recommend to anyone who wants to stay comfortable and yet in a budget at Tirchy!"
15,"when arrived at Hotel was treated and greeted  well and was a very smooth Check in as well check out, Hotel location is excellent Has a nice gym and good Restaurant, food is excellent , Breakfast at Buffet was ample and excellent choice of different dishes  for different type of Customers.Room service is very well and an excellent as taking up a social cause  by employing deaf and mute people for room-service, which was excellently performed by them. Over all it is a four star hotel at the cost of three star hotel . Really a full value of money,"
16,"I accidentally booked the hotel for a different date but turned up at the hotel on the day I intended to book. The front staff were accommodating, found us a room, and offered us a full refund for the booked dates. Easy access to local restaurants and decent size hotel. You get what you pay for...I would stay here again. "
17,I had a comfortable and pleasent stay for 2 weeks in this hotel. The key highlights are 1. Nice air-conditioned room with attached bathroom and 24/7 hot water supply.especially the hot shower after my whole day work was awesome. 2. Excellent house keeping everyday... Credits Dhivya 3. Fabulous food served in the in-house cafe... Credits to all serving staff 4. Polite and caring staff.
18,"WE stayed at Hotel Red Fox, a component of Lemon Tree hotels in Tiruchirapalli during the night of 18Th February 2020. We are a family group on pilgrimage to near by Srirangam and pre booked 3 Business Rooms.  The hotel in a very congested area in Rockins Road, Cantonment  and it will be bit difficult to locate the hotel even with Google maps. However once entering the hotel, its quite decent and elegant. The rooms are spacious, very clean and tidy with very clean sheets and towels. The double bed is comfortable. Few furniture items provided are of good quality. Bathroom is quite clean and enough toiletries provided. Coffee kettle and sufficient items were provided for making coffee and tea. The Front desk and other staff are decent and helpful. Now a days most of the hotels are‚Ä¶"
19,"Wonderful experience in the hotel in terms of food, room cleaning and housekeeping, Manager's and all the staffs are very cooperative. Special thanks to housekeeping person divya for her work. Thanks and request visitors to choose best hotel for best trip forever."
20,"Stayed with my family here, had booked here by looking at reviews online and it was nice stay.staff are young which is + for this hotel they are attentive and helping. There are deaf people employed which is great cause to improve their living hood hats off to the management for such a gesture."
21,"Had recently stayed in January during Pongal Holidays and had a wonderful stay, staff are young and cheerful. Breakfast was nice, Pongal was too good I liked it and requested for next day also which was served without hesitation. Thank you. See you next year guys."
22,"I have stayed a few times in this prosperity. What I felt was the team being young needs training, frequent monitoring and a feedback system to understand customer requirements. I had booked on phone. As a cooperate client I usually get a better pricing. This time the person who took the phone was cut and dry, a bit harsh. Take it or leave it attitude.  For this industry this isn't good. Moreover this hotel is frequented by a lot of foreigners. Yes almost full every time  I was there.  The team needs support staff help or the person at the front desk can't handle hence become frustrated and behalf differently which has a negative impact.  This I could feel in the restaurant too. Crowded the staff feel stressed and frustrated. In a sweet corn chicken soup fried chicken was put.‚Ä¶"
23,"My friend I we booked to stay in this hotel for 3 weeks but we had to change our hotel less then two weeks because the rude, uneducated, unprofessional staff and they don't have social skills that how to treat customers even thier manager hasn't any social skills. They all need training about how to treat customers. Food also wasn't good."
24,"I don't know where to begin to describe how bad this hotel was, most of the the staff were very rude (however the housekeeping staff, Sathiya in the restaurant and one young woman at reception were nice). Most of the restaurant staff and the manager were very rude, had no social skills and had no idea how to speak to people. They were unprofessional and lacked training. When we walked into the restaurant there was no welcome, if the staff did bother to look at us they did so as if we were dirt and disturbing them. The food was nothing special and lacked taste. We checked out of the hotel more than a week early but the reception staff did not ask why or if we had had a good stay. I was very disappointed as I have stayed at other Red Fox and Lemon Tree hotels before and had‚Ä¶"
25,The services provided by hotel is good and housekeeping staff is also friendly.. The lady dhivya is also good as i was new in this area and she recommends me many places to visit and she is also has good skills of house keeping...
26,"Red Fox Hotel in Trichy could be used as a benchmark for exemplary customer service. I have not seen any other hotel staff so prompt and willing to help customers in all ways possible. It is located right opposite to the Trichy central bus stand and very close to the Railway Station. The location is so convenient. You walk out and you can get whatever you want. I traveled with my husband and my kid and the best thing was I could get enough options for the kids food - dal khichdi, boiled vegetables, cornflakes milk, hot chocolate, and so on. Though my child is a fussy eater, I did not have trouble at Red Fox. Not only that, one day before check out, my child got unwell. Red Fox Staff were extremely cooperative and kind to send us to hospital in their car and even called the‚Ä¶"
27,"It was just a day's visit.  Found this to be a great place for a business or leisure traveller who is looking to stay close to the public transport facilities in Trichy.  The Bus Terminal is right in-front of the hotel, airport and railway station is within 15 mins distance.  It is also quite easy to find local taxi cars and auto rickshaws in/around the hotel gate."
28,I stayed in red fox for 4 days. Room service is great. and rooms are also clean .  Specially housekeeping is excellent . i stayed on first floor where Housekeeping girl DIVYA  maintaining & cleaning the rooms. I recommend everyone for this hotel. Thanks for good stay.
29,"Clean, modern , friendly , great location ! Loved it. Pleasantly surprised to find such a hotel in Trichy. So happy to come back to our room after a marvellously hectic day out in the city. Would highly recommend a stay here to anyone ."
30,"RedFox Hotel is a decent hotel with good, friendly staff. It was economical. The rooms were not large, but were just nice and clean. The buffet spread was decent and the food was good. A good stay for a solo traveler or business people."
31,"We stayed here for three nights exploring the local area. The Red Fox is a great find. We had excellent service from start to finish. Reception staff were very welcoming, room very comfortable and superb food was served in the evening.  Great value and first class in every respect. Loved it!"
32,"The Red Fox had the same wonderful ethos as it‚Äôs mother hotel, the Lemon Tree. We didn‚Äôt spend long, but long enough to experience super-efficient WiFi, great service with that little extra that makes all the difference ‚Äì like the fresh uttapam the restaurant manager cooked for me ‚Äì thank you. We were nice and close for our first visit, Rock Forte."
33,"I have stayed for almost a month this time in Red fox. Restaurant and housekeeping is really good here. They have a very nice and friendly staff. From housekeeping team, Dhivya is working on my floor. She always greets guests with a big smile and is very good at her work."
34,Really stunned to see the innovative decoration in evenings after back to room... I will really says ... it is one of the best housekeeping which I have never seen before...  Appreciated for the work...üëåüëåüëå
35,"Stayed with family for a day to visit srirangam temple, rooms were clean and neat with all basic amenities. Room attended was kind enough to clean our room twice. Special thanks to him. Will visit again."
36,"Stayed here for 2 days, thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff are very accommodative and help full, breakfast was nice with South Indian varieties in authentic taste. Will surely recommend to all. Thank you team Red Fox."
37,Stayed here with family.  Location: very near to station and bus stand. Very accessible Condition of property: seems to be a new property and well maintained Room: small but nice. More suitable for business traveller rather than holiday people Restaurant: went for lunch and was informed only biriyani and sandwiches available. So skipped. What really surprised me was the table mats. They had jokes which are not suitable for young people. In the enthusiasm of being funny this hotel forgot basic hygiene! Fitness center: very basic Bar: simple one Parking facility: yes Sleep quality: firm mattress and good 
38,"Friendly staff all over the hotel, giving the chance for the special people was very touching.  Wonderful service by all staff especially Gokul from front desk. Brilliant hotel and everything is nearby. See you guys soon."
39,"Coueous staff, Very clean & ready room, toilet & linen. Quick response from the staff - always. Full time hot water! Tasty, fresh & good spread for breakfast! Restaurant very neatly arranged and staff were available there too always to attend us and serve freshly prepared dishes on order. Not had any unpleasant moment during our two full days and night stay. Red Fox theme in the corridors, rooms and lounge is very interesting and different experience. Location - accessible to almost everything. Will come back again Red Fox team Trichy!."
40,"Stayed for one night along with my Family ( 2 Adults + 2 Kids). The room was spacious with a small living room & comfortable for my family. The rooms were clean , neat with comfortable bed with one extra bed at additional charges. The washrooms were clean & hygienic with right amount of toiletries. Both the room services & house keeping were good with immediate response on call.  The front desk staff were courteous and so is the front office manager Selva ramar who took the reservation. The restaurant is good and especially the break fast spread was really good with lot of varieties. Tried their Mutton briyani , it was really good and value for money.  They have a small fitness centre which i used.  Only improvement i feel is the parking area. Probably due to the lack of space.‚Ä¶"
41,"Great for a brief stopover in Trichy. Service was prompt and friendly. Particularly suitable for those on business. Great breakfast options and comfortable rooms. Decent dining options in the surrounding area, though quite noisy due to the hotel being situated across from the bus interchange."
42,The hotel which is walking distance from the railway station and opposite the bus stand is a good choice to stay in Trichy. The decor was nice and the rooms appeared to be well maintained. The staff were courteous and prompt both in the restaurant and also while providing room service. The food was good and reasonably priced. Overall a hotel without much hassles which gave us a good impression of the brand 
43,"The hotel is in the center of town, hence convenient for travel. The rooms are clean but slightly worned out. Good breakfast spread. The hotel chain employs hearing and speech impaired personnel as staff which is highly commendable. I personally choose to support businesses with ethical values such as this. I will be staying here again during my next visit. I would like to give special mention to Ms Flora who was lovely to deal with at the front desk."
44,Excellent Hotel with helpful staff.Abdul in house keeping department was very much caring.I recommend travellers to stay in this hotel whenever they are in Trichy. Its near railway station and 30 mts drive from airport.
45,"Hotel has excellent location just at the central bus stand and near all the prominent landmark. Hotel is quite modern looking, new and well maintained. Food is excellent with decent buffet spread for the breakfast.  Opportunity for improvements:  1. There is centralized AC with a fixed remote away from the bed. The AC does not cut-off when the set temperature is reached and you need to get up in the middle of the night to go and switch it off. When we gave this as a feedback, we got the response that since TN is hot, we have kept it this way. Did not buy this argument at all  2. Service speed at the room is a tad slow  3. No Hindi/ English channels on the TV which reception told can be made available on the request  Overall good experience. It ismore like a business hotel at a‚Ä¶"
46,I could receive the best service from the hotel when ever I visit Trichy.. I used to visit the hotel all the months in regular basis and it's almost very satisfying for me to stay there .

51,"i got delighted after entering in my room , it was nicely arranged and cleaned by dhivya, FTC. Everyday, she was making beautiful animal and flower with the help of towels. outstanding remarks to her work, restuarant staffs are also well behaved and caring. Hotel manager Mr Selvaramar is very nice and competent, room size is little smaller, but other amenities are very nice in this hotel."
52,"A very decent place for extended or short stays in almost heart of the city bang opposite to the bus stand and walkable distance from the station. New to the service, may be an year or two. Rooms & washrooms though compact, are clean. Bath and bed linens clean too. Thanks to the Shanthi, from housekeeping, serving the floor where I stayed. Clever Fox, the restaurant at ground floor offers decent spread. But I must highlight all the differently abled staffs into the service who are extremely smart in their job. Fantastic & Well Done Team. "
53,"Wonderful stay. Totally worth for the money. The quality of the rooms, amenities, service, just about everything was excellent. Wonderful spread of  breakfast buffet. Staff were fantastic. Specially, hiring of non speaking and hearing staffs. Ideal for business travelers. Quick check in/ Check out. Would be my first choice if I go to Trichy again."

57,Had a 4 day stay in Redfox trichy. overall good stay. Room service by Mr Abdul was excellent. Can refer this hotel to friends and family. Only issue is their in room dine charges and value for money for it. But u have plenty of options outside hotel itself
58,"Room was good, staffs were friendly..   Continuous knock and doorbell ringing at 11.00 AM when i was taking a shower...  Opened the door and to my surprise 4 Officers in police uniform standing outside and said they are here for verification.  Half naked took them 30 minutes.. One of officer was recording in the mobile..  Will never recommend anyone to stay here."

61,I come from Malaysia to trichy for my friend wedding and I had a pleasant stay in our red fox hotel. I got warm welcome from front desk assistant Gokul he gave great hospitality and assist us Wanderfully.I would like to come over again.
62,"I was stayed in our Red Fox hotel at Trichy on Nov 8th to 10th of 2019 along with my friends from Malaysia. We had a pleasant stay & good hospitality down there, where it all starts from the front Office to room stay. I would like to leave a review note to Mr.Gokul in front office for his kind full assistance for our stay all the way from front desk until we check out indeed.  Really appreciable. Keep Going!"

65,Nice place to stay. Near from Central Bus stand. Food was good and staffs were courteous .Definitely I will recommend this hotel to my friends. Cleaning and comfortableness awesme.. Totaly satisfied stay...
66,"Hardly any space in the room, so if you're planning a 1 day and 1 night trip even.. and with kid, I would not recommend. Very bare bones. The folks at the reception looked beyond bored. The breakfast however was quite decent. So if you're on a shoestring budget, spending hardly any time in the room and all you want is clean space and an Air con that works- go for it!"
67, i booked first time Red Fox and liked in house services specially Housekeeping Department  Ms. Shanthi (Working for Red Fox Since 2016) has good communication skill and good in her job. She is very professional and keep rooms always in order. I really appreciated her way of working and she make sure 0 complain specially for housekeeping department . A very good resource for Red Fox. I will def book my next reservation at Red Fox. In house dining and reception team are equally good  
68,"I have stayed in this hotel for my business trip and I'm amazed to see such an active housekeeping staff like Ms.Dhivya at housekeeping if I am remembering her name correctly as she made sure and ensured that all of my needs were met on time and attended professionally. I have requested for some extra amenities and toiletries and She extended her courteous gesture and visited me and I liked to see such a courteous staff. I liked the way she helped me and will certainly recommend this hotel to my other friends and relatives.  Regards, Raj_9790648038."
69,"Any room which is spic and span, clean toilet, wth a soft mattress, and a fast wi-fi qualifies as an excellent room for me. Red Fox Hotel Trichy has all of the above. Special mention about Dhivya from the house keeping department, she not only gave a prompt service for cleaning the room and picking the laundry but also told me about all the various places where I should be visiting in Trichy. Keep up the good work Red Fox"
70,Really I enjoyed my stay in  Redfox Hotel for First Time So Hotel is Good. And Service is Excellent all Staff are Good Specially House Keeping Ms.Shanthi Neatly Arranged Good Service I Will Recommend To My Friends And Relatives I Will come Again (Good Job Shanthi) Again

72,It is a no no sense hotel with basic facilities . The room was ok the check in process fast and sow as check out . WIFI worked well Location at city's  bus stop makes it easier to  have eating options around  with lots of shops and eateries . Good value for money.
73,This time really food taste very worst taste. Improve your food taste. I eat breakfast taste very poor. Don't stay anyone's cost was high. Food taste and quality very worst. Worst restaurants service. Food taste worst.
74,"Excelent services, staff is having kind nature, clean rooms and also better food quality! (Abdul) one of thos staff members does his work so Kindheartedly and also other staff members were of benevolent nature!  washrooms bathrooms were also so managed and neat!

79,We stayed here for a night as part of our Srirangam temple visit program. Hotel is decent for families. Ample car parking available. Driver accomodation is also available. Very close to central bus stand. Many decent Veg and Non veg hotels are available near by. We did not try the complimentary breakfast as we had to start early morning to Srirangam temple. Special kudos for employing differently abled person. Over all recommended for business and short stays as families in Trichy
80,The hotel is located near the bus stand.The room I stayed in was pretty basic but clean.The WiFi was not working due to some password issues.The staff need to be more sensitive to guests .But overall value for money.
81,Clean and neat ambience. Staff are very cordial. Shanthi from housekeeping was very helpful and she did a excellent service. Overall had a good stay. Worth the money spent. Would like to comeback again.
82,Overall housekeeping (Staff name  e : Shanthi)....warm reception ( staff name : Gokul)...homely food taste at restaurant ....its also very nearby to bussatnd so reach is gud even if we come by train or bus
83,"Food is what I would like to mention first! I booked a room at this hotel for my parents who were traveling. Initially they were sceptical about the rates and booking an expensive room in a place like Trichy. However they completely enjoyed their three day stay. The rooms and the bathrooms were very good, with sufficient storage and locker facilities. They told me that they had a wonderful stay and had a good sleep at a new place.  My parents wanted to do an early check out but stayed just because they loved the breakfast Buffett there. Will definitely book again. "
84,We all had a pleasant and wonderful stay. The location is just opposite of new bus stop and you can travel with local bus to old bus stop which opposite of shopping are. The bus fare is INR 8 per way. very convenient.

90,I stayed here for two nights on a business trip.  It is the only branded chain hotel in town. The rooms are good and so is the food. The service is average. The buffet breakfast is decent but you wont get a chance to eat as it is overcrowded at all times.
91,One of the best hotels in trichy with good ambiance and friendly staff. Hotel stay will be comfortable they provide free morning breakfast and it's worth the money spent. It's so near to central bustabd and railway station
